===========
=WISH LIST=
===========
DONE - detect if cryptsetup is there in case of --luks
DONE - detect if unxz is there in case of installing exherbo
DONE - --luks genkernel support for unstable: ~gentoo, funtoo (need baselayout-2)
DONE |- profile parsing
DONE |- cryptsetup calls
DONE - dist=funtoo install support
DONE |- profile parsing
DONE |- git checkout call
DONE  |- move all code to profile side (see doc/~funtoo.profile)
DONE - Extend kicktoo-rescue to non luks users
DONE |- autodetect cryptsetup or clear device 
DONE |- mount $1
     - create kernel with initramfs for exherbo (patch genkernel or rewrite?) => just rewrite within profile
DONE - dist=exherbo install support
DONE |- profile parsing
DONE |- exheres sync repo support 
DONE |- install_portage_tree to install_repo_tree w/ exheres support
DONE  |- move all code to profile side (see doc/exherbo.profile)
DONE - revert all gentoo/funtoo/exherbo specific logic from inner code to template side
     - always keep code generic, never include distro specific logic inside kicktoo: use profiles
DONE - provide new default gentoo/funtoo/exherbo installation profiles
DONE - add lzma stage tarball support
DONE - add bzip2 stage tarball support 
DONE - add gzip stage tarball supprt 
DONE - add xz stage tarball support
     - add LiLo boot support (default will always stay Grub)
     - add swap partition as extended by default instead of primary (this would allow gentoo-lvm.profile and another system to dual boot)
     - add some work about the new kernel 'make localmodconfig' from 2.6.32
DROP - exherbo: add eclectic rc boot config support for exherbo (rcadd option) => rewrite within profile
     - add 'precompiled' options to $kernel_sources and provide a binary kernel instead of sources (gain time)
       - 1 kernel for normal install
       - 1 kernel for luks install
       - 1 kernel for lvm install
     - fetch profile from URL
       - pass option to edit provided profile before running install process
     - give a config option PRELOAD_CONFIG_URI with url to tar-ball with initial config and more

=FIXMES=
========
DONE - gentoo/funtoo: parsing bug timezone & hostname & keymap functions don't work with unstable ~gentoo and ~funtoo
DONE  |- reason: variables lowercase w/ baselayout-2 as uppercase w/ baselayout-1
DONE - sanity-check-config: dist=exherbo and tree_type=sync restricted
DONE - sanity-check-config: dist=funtoo  and tree_type=snapshot restricted
DONE - sanity-check-config: dist=exherbo and tree_type=sync restricted
     - sanitize sanity-check-config (for use with -s option): does half what it should
DONE - rc-update added by default after service build: should let user choose in profile
DONE  - loggind_daemon
DONE  - cron daemon
DONE - exherbo: need detect_baselayout2() because of unstable stage3 (gentoo, funtoo)
DONE - exherbo: need detect_grub2() because of config breakage (modules/misc.sh) BUGGY!!
DONE - rescue: need checking for cryptsetup device for modules/rescue.sh
DONE - exherbo: support for /dev/pts (critical) => reverse change and add -o rbind to /dev instead of bind.
DONE - gentoo/funtoo: chpasswd invalid option resolved on 0.2.4 using -pam and rebuilding shadow (see doc/~funtoo*profile patch inside)
